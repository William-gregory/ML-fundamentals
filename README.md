# ML-fundamentals
The Jupyter Notebook PRML.ipynb contains coded examples, which i have written myself, outlining various fundamental statistical concepts related to pattern recognition and machine learning, as covered in both textbooks by [Bishop, 2006](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf) and [Rasmussen & Williams, 2006](http://gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/).

With the addition of some more recent work into multi-task GPs from [Stegle et al., 2011](https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/bitstream/handle/2066/91758/91758.pdf) and [Rakitsch et al., 2013](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2013/file/59c33016884a62116be975a9bb8257e3-Paper.pdf).
