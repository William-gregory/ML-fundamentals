# PRML
The Jupyter Notebook PRML.ipynb contains coded examples, which i have written myself, outlining various fundamental statistical concepts related to pattern recognition and machine learning, as covered in both textbooks:

Bishop, C.M., 2006. Pattern recognition and machine learning. springer.

Rasmussen, C.E. and Williams, C.K., 2006. Gaussian processes for machine learning, MIT press.



With the addition of some more recent work into multi-task GPs from:

Stegle, O., Lippert, C., Mooij, J.M., Larence, N.D. and Borgwardt, K., 2011. Efficient inference in matrix-variate Gaussian models with iid observation noise.

Rakitsch, B., Lippert, C., Borgwardt, K. and Stegle, O., 2013, December. It is all in the noise: Efficient multi-task Gaussian process inference with structured residuals. In Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems-Volume 1 (pp. 1466-1474).
