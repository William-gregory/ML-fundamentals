# ML-fundamentals
This is a working repository where I'm putting together educational resources for getting to grips with statistics and machine learning. The aim is to have a series of directories which contain code relating to fundamental concepts of ML, ranging from linear algebra, to curve-fitting, as well as different flavours of machine learning.

Much of the materials in this repository are taken from textbooks [Bishop, 2006](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf) and [Rasmussen & Williams, 2006](http://gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/), along with some additional works relating to more specific methodologies of modern ML methods. These additional works are cited throughout the various notebooks.
